People say nice of it.\r\n* I start learning Python at [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com), practicing with the basic concepts, Being aware of and appreciating their preaching that Python is all about automation.\r\n* I used **Matlab** to remove random dots in my _Tif_ files.\r\n* I used Matlab to peek into my .dta file. I later also used Python to crack the .dta.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Aha moments\r\n* Turing's machine, computational completeness.\r\n* \r\n\r\nWhen I We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use.
